Adds a widget with a user recognition game.

== Description ==

This Plugin adds a widget with a user recognition game. In a configurable time interval, the avatar of a random user is shown to each visitor of your site. The visitor will have a configurable number of choices of registered user names on your site. The visitor can pick one choice and will be informed of he/she was right or wrong. This plugin is integrated with [BadgeOS](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS") as it addes triggers to be used as achivement steps. Furthermore it integrates with [BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress/ "BuddyPress") as it links the users avatar with his/her profile page on completion of the game. Neither of both plugins are requirements though.

This plugin was originally developed for the [globe - Community of Digital Learning](https://quality4digitallearning.org/) on behalf of [GIZ](https://www.giz.de/).
